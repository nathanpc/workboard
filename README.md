# WorkBoard

A "bulletin board" web interface for brainstorming your personal projects.


## What is this?

Usually when I'm working on a project I tend to write a whole bunch of Post-Its
and save important URLs in browser windows and some times save them to a text
file. This is messy and makes it very difficult to come back to a project after
a while. This project aims to replace all those Post-Its and random files.
It'll be equaly messy, only this time it's digital.


## Why Classic ASP?

I love playing around with retro technologies, and since this was a simple
project, that most likely I'm the only one that's going to use, I've decided
to have some fun and build it using [Classic ASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages)
and [Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver).
